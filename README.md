# Movie Application

My first project using React.js

# Functionalities

Since it is my first attempt at React.js, this application allows one to search for movies/tv shows. 

You can type the name of the movie in the search bar, and all relevant titles along with their posters will show up. Also, the date on which the relevant movie was released is shown too.
